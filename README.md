## Analytics Projects

- #### <a href="https://github.com/Nubwajohn/Model-Tuning-Project" title="Model Tuning Project">Model Tuning Project</a> ReneWind

*Objective* : The goal is to create and improve models to predict generator failures, reduce costly missed failures (requiring replacement), and balance repair costs for correct predictions and inspection costs for false alarms.

*Result* : The model relies heavily on key features like V36, V18, and V14, while many others have little impact, suggesting the model could be improved by focusing on the most important features.

- #### <a href="https://github.com/Nubwajohn/Ensemble-Techniques-Project" title="Ensemble Techniques Project">Ensemble Techniques Project</a> EasyVisa.

*Objective* : Use data analysis and a classification model to streamline visa approvals by identifying key factors and recommending certification or denial for applicants.

*Result* : Visa certification is influenced by education, experience, wages, region, and wage unit, with minimal impact from organization size, age, and training.

- #### <a href="https://github.com/Nubwajohn/Supervised-Learning-Classification-Project" title="Supervised Learning Classification Project">Supervised Learning Classification Project</a> INN Hotels.

*Objective* : Predict cancellations and identify key factors to optimize refund policies.

*Result* : Implement tiered policies, non-refundable rates, rebooking options, deposits, insurance, fees, loyalty incentives, discounts, and credits to balance satisfaction and revenue.

- #### <a href="https://github.com/Nubwajohn/Supervised-Learning-Project" title= "Supervised Learning Project">Supervised Learning Project</a> Recell Price Prediction.

*Objective* : Predict prices of used electronic devices to guide inventory pricing.

*Result* : Achieved a deviation of only 4.5% from actual prices and explained 84% of variance in device pricing.

- #### <a href="https://github.com/Nubwajohn/Business-Statistics-Project" title= "Statistics Project"> Statistics Project</a> E-news Express Landing Page Analysis.

*Objective* : Analyze user engagement post-landing page redesign.

*Result* : Demonstrated a significant increase in user engagement (p<0.05) and consistent results across language preferences.

- #### <a href="https://github.com/Nubwajohn/Python-Project" title= "Python Project">Python Project </a> FoodHub Customer Insight Analysis. 
  
*Objective* : Provide insights into customer behavior and restaurant performance.

*Result*: Identified top-performing restaurants and cuisines, average delivery time, and suggested strategies to boost revenue.
